                    <br> Chances are you have heard or worked with Git. It is one of the most popular code management systems in the world. But it can be quite daunting to comprehend the inner workings of this system, especially if you are collaborating with others and working on multiple branches.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    This project's goal is to essentially demystify the Git version control system. If you are new to Git and if you ever wondered about the underlying process, you're at the right place.

                    <div class="title">So, what is Git?</div>
                    Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files. For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>What makes git unique?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users.</li>
                        <li>Git is a distributed version control system. Every user gets their own local repository, complete with a full history of commits.</li>
                        <li>Having a full local history makes Git fast, since it means you don’t need a network connection to create commits, inspect previous versions of a file, or perform diffs between commits.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="title">The Git Places Model</div>
                    <br/> Where does git store your files? Contrary to what you'd think, it's not just your computer and the cloud. In Git, there are five places your source can exist:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Stash</li>
                        <li>A Local working directory.</li>
                        <li>An Index (or staging area)</li>
                        <li>a local repository</li>
                        <li>A remote repository</li>
                    </ul>
                        The first four are located in each user's personal computer, whereas the remote repository is shared by all users. Scroll down to learn more about them!

                    <div class="title">Workspace</div>
                    This is the local working directory for your local repository whose contents are checked out in the branch you are working in.

                    <div class="title">Index</div>
                    These include the files you want to commit. This is considered the staging area where the files you intend to commit are temporarily tracked.
                    Before you “commit” (checkin) files, you need to first add them to the index. Also called "current directory cache", "staging area", "cache" or "staged files".

                <section class="step local-rep-sec">
                    <div class="title">Local Repository</div>
                    Git local repository is the one on which we will make local changes, typically this local repository is on our computer.
                    It contains a subdirectory named `.git` that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. 
                    The default name for a local branch is <strong>"master"</strong>.
                </section>
                <section class="step remote-rep-sec">
                    <div class="title">Remote Repository</div>
                    Git remote repository is a remotely hosted service which stores a version(s) of your code, ensuring all your changes are available for other developers. The default name for a remote is <strong>"origin"</strong>.

                <section class="step stash-sec">
                    <div class="title">Stash</div>
                    This is a place where you can store your code changes while you are trying to pull in the latest version from the remote repository.

                    <div class="title">Commands Move Files</div>
                     While collaborating with people on the same repository, we regularly encounter situations when we need to either update our local folders
                     to take up changes that someone else has made. Similarly, we push our code to the remote repository when we want to update the codebase so others can access the new version. It is therefore, critical to understand the idea of code flowing upstream (from your computer to the cloud repository) and downstream (from the cloud repository to your computer). Scroll down to understand how Git commands move your files.
                </section>
                <section class="step upstream-sec">
                    <div class="title">Scenario 1: Share with the world!</div>
                    <p>
                    Let's say you are working on a blog post. You <a nohref id="upstream-create-link" class="dotty"> create, edit and save a new file </a>. How do you let the world know about it?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Try <a nohref id="upstream-add-link" class="dotty"> git add </a> to start tracking files, which you intend to commit and share. Make as many changes, as you wish and keep adding it to the staging area. </p>

                    <p>Once you are ready, use <a nohref id="upstream-commit-link" class="dotty"> git commit </a> to move these changes out of the temporary index to your local repository. Each commit creates a new commit node in a commit tree structure stored in the .git subdirectory. If you wish to "undo" a commit, Git can track these changes in the tree.</p>

                    <p> After committing multiple versions of the file, use <a nohref id="upstream-push-link" class="dotty"> git push </a> to send the file over to the cloud repository. Your blog post is now available to all your collaborators!
                    </p>

                <section class="step downstream-sec">
                    <div class="title">Scenario 2: Bringing New Opinions</div>
                   <p>
                        Let's say that you finalized your version of the blog post and pushed it to the cloud. Your team can now makes changes, and your <a nohref id="downstream-others-push-link" class="dotty"> co-author pushes a new version </a> to the cloud. How do you see the combined file? With downstream commands!
                   </p>

                    <p>
                        First, you can carefully bring the changes to your local repository using <a nohref id="downstream-fetch-link" class="dotty"> git fetch </a>. This doesn't change your workspace, so you can potentially still see and/or change your old blog post.
                        Then, with <a nohref id="downstream-merge-link" class="dotty"> git merge </a> the combined file is now reflected in your directory and a node is automatically added in the commit tree.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Alternatively, if you feel lazy, you can use <a nohref id="downstream-pull-link" class="dotty"> git pull </a> that does a fetch and merge combined.The caveat: Merge and pull work on a clean working directory, i.e. without any uncommitted/ untracked changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Often, the cloud repository changes while you are working on files as well.
                        Let's create a simple website for a team project. You <a nohref id="updown-edit-link" class="dotty"> create and start editing an HTML file</a>, as your co-author pushes an image to the repository. How do you bring this image file into your current directory? 
                    </p>

                    <p> If you try to <a nohref id="updown-pull-link" class="dotty"> git pull </a>
                        like earlier, it won't work! That's because your working directory has untracked changes!
                    </p>

                    <p> You don't want to delete this HTML file, or commit/push it yet. With <a nohref id="updown-stash-link" class="dotty"> git stash </a>, you can store away all these uncommitted and untracked changes temporarily. Try the pull command again to see the difference.
                    </p>

                    <p> Restoring your work in progress, is now easy. Use <a nohref id="updown-pop-link" class="dotty"> git pop </a> to clear out the stash, and bring back your changes to the working directory.
